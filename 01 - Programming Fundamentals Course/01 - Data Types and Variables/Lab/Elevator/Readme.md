<h4>Hints</h4>
</br>
If you use types like float or double, the result will lose some of its precision. Also it might be printed in scientific notation.</br>
You might use the decimal data type which holds real numbers with high precision with less loss.</br>
Note that decimal numbers sometimes hold the unneeded zeroes after the decimal point, so 0m is different than 0.0m and 0.00000m.</br>
